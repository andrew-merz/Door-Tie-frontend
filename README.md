# Door-Tie

Having a roommate can be awkward. So I created an app called door-tie aimed at cutting down on some of the awkwardness between roommates. Door-Tie is aimed at students, particularly college roommates. This is a shared status checker app where users can check whether or not their roommates are home, and their particular status.
The purpose of this app is to remove the need to text or call your roommate for everything, instead you can just check their status.
